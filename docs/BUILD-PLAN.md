# Community Support Platform — Build Plan

> The roadmap, mapped: what's done, what's next, and how each phase depends on the others. Pairs with `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

---

## Product arc

> Turn a stream of community questions into a **self-improving knowledge base that deflects repeat questions** — automatically, with humans only on the long tail.

✅ Auth gate            (PR #5)
✅ Embeddings + dedup + answer reuse   (PR #6)   ── A, B, C
✅ Confidence + auto-deflect           (PR #7)   ── D
✅ Feedback loop                       (PR #9)   ── E
✅ Knowledge base surface              (PR #12)  ── F
✅ Analytics                           (PR #13)  ── G
── Hardening track runs alongside (prod readiness)

Auth (#5) ─────────────────────────────► (gates everything; independent)

Embeddings/Dedup/Reuse (#6) ─┬─► Confidence/Auto-deflect (#7) ─┬─► Feedback (E) ─► better retrieval
                             │                                 │

Hardening (tests, prod Docker, observability, rate-limit) ── parallel, no blockers

## Phases

### ✅ A–C. Semantic enrichment — PR #6 (done)
Embed each post, link to nearest prior tickets, reuse resolved answers in the agent.
**Files:** `lib/ai/embed.ts`, `lib/ai/related.ts`, `lib/db/queries/embeddings.ts`, schema side tables.

### ✅ D. Confidence + auto-deflect — PR #7 (done)
Reviewer pass grades each answer; high confidence → auto-answer, else human queue.
**Files:** `lib/ai/assess.ts`, `lib/db/queries/assessments.ts`, dashboard stats, ticket badges.

### ✅ E. Feedback loop  *(done)*
Capture whether an answer was good, feed it back into retrieval and thresholds.
- 👍/👎 Discord reaction collector in `bot/handlers.ts` → `/api/feedback` → `ticket_feedback` table.
- Staff 👍/👎 buttons on ticket detail page via `FeedbackButtons` + `submitFeedbackAction`.
- `getPriorAnswers` filters out negatively-rated tickets and orders by net score.
- Per-category deflection accuracy table on the Analytics page.
- **Files:** `bot/handlers.ts`, `app/api/feedback/route.ts`, `lib/db/queries/feedback.ts`, `components/tickets/feedback-buttons.tsx`, `app/actions/feedback.ts`, `app/(dashboard)/analytics/page.tsx`.

### ✅ F. Knowledge base surface — PR #12 (done)
Turn resolved answers into a durable, searchable asset instead of a weekly FAQ blob.
- `kb_articles` table: canonical Q + answer, embedding, source ticket(s), published flag.
- "Promote to KB" action on a resolved ticket.
- Semantic search page (reuse embedding + cosine infra) — staff first, public optionally.
- Agent retrieves from KB articles, not just raw prior tickets.
- **Files:** `app/(dashboard)/kb/page.tsx`, `lib/db/queries/kb.ts`, `components/tickets/promote-kb-button.tsx`.

### ✅ G. Analytics — PR #13 (done)
Prove ROI and drive the roadmap.
- Deflection rate (auto-answered ÷ total), trend over time.
- Trending topics via embedding clusters.
- Doc-gap report: resolved how-to tickets not yet in the KB.
- SLA attainment, time-to-first-response.
- Per-category deflection accuracy from 👍/👎 feedback.
- **Files:** `app/(dashboard)/analytics/page.tsx`, `lib/db/queries/analytics.ts`, `lib/analytics/roi.ts`.

## Hardening track (parallel — production readiness)

Run alongside feature phases; none block the others.

| Item | Why | Effort |
|------|-----|--------|
| ✅ **Resend email notifications** | alert admins/owners on new critical/high tickets, ticket resolved, SLA breach; `lib/email/send.ts`; skips silently when `RESEND_API_KEY` absent | S |
| **Tests** | zero today; cover SLA engine, triage, related, assess, ingest | M |
| **Prod Docker** | compose runs `pnpm dev` + bind-mount; build a real image, `pnpm start`, persistent SQLite volume, gitignore `data/*.db*` | S |
| **Observability** | AI work runs in `after()` and fails silently; add structured logging + retry/dead-letter for agent/embeds | M |
| **Rate limiting + input caps** | ingest takes unbounded content = AI cost + DoS risk | S |
| **Migrations** | schema applied via `IF NOT EXISTS`; need a real migration story before the next schema change that isn't a new side table | M |
| **Auth v2** | shared password → GitHub/Google OAuth (proxy stays; swap session source) | M |
| **Node version** | Next 16 needs Node ≥ 20.9; pin via `.nvmrc` / `engines` | S |

## Recommended next order

1. ~~**E — Feedback loop.**~~ ✅ Done (PR #9).
2. ~~**G — Analytics.**~~ ✅ Done (PR #13).
3. ~~**F — KB surface.**~~ ✅ Done (PR #12).
4. ~~**Resend email notifications.**~~ ✅ Done (this PR).
5. **Hardening — Prod Docker + observability + rate-limit** before deployment.

## How a contributor picks up work

- Each phase = one focused branch + PR, stacked when dependent (see graph).
- Pattern established: side tables over `ALTER`; AI calls wrapped in try/catch; verify with `tsc --noEmit`, a clean `pnpm build`, and logic tests on a throwaway SQLite DB (`DB_PATH=$(mktemp)` + `tsx`).
- Keep `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` current when the pipeline changes.
